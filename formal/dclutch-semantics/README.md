# dClutch Lean semantic specializer

This experimental package asks one decisive architectural question: can Lean own
the meaning of dClutch transitions and emit compact, bounded first-order data for
a very small SBF executor?

The first slice defines one inline ordinary Direct fill independently of the
Rust implementation. It currently provides:

- `ProductIR`, `FrameIR`, and typed `EffectPlan` data;
- a width-independent Direct admission predicate;
- exact integer quote and one named floor-fee boundary;
- a seven-effect plan;
- a total checked effect interpreter;
- machine-checked claim and collateral conservation;
- gap-free replay advancement;
- whole-state rollback on refusal;
- a cumulative-fee telescoping theorem; and
- executable admitted and hostile fixtures.

Run:

```sh
lake build
```

This is not a formal-verification claim for the deployed Solana program. See
`TRUST.md` for the exact boundary and `docs/decisions/0002-lean-semantic-specializer.md`
at the repository root for the succession criteria.
