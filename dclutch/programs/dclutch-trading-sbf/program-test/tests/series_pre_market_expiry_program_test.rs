//! Current-source positive pre-Market Series Expire campaign through the real
//! Registry, Trading, Core, Custody, and Claims ELFs.
//!
//! Fixture construction lives here; the release compiler remains owned by
//! `dclutch_trading_sbf::series::release_v5`, and the physical evidence joins
//! remain owned by the adjacent support module.
//!
//! # THREE ROWS ARE STILL RED, AND NOW THE FIXTURE IS THE AUTHOR
//!
//! That is the whole change of state, and it is the opposite of the header
//! this replaces. The Series Expire ARTIFACT SET no longer contradicts itself:
//! `97ce7a748` keyed the family's proof geometry on the Template that owns it,
//! so the Expire RequestProfile pins `series_action_request_bytes_v3(count)`
//! and route 4 declares its borrowed range only when the canonical proof is
//! nonempty. This campaign stages a ONE-occurrence Template, `proof_height(1)`
//! is zero, and both halves now agree on 128 bytes with no range at all.
//!
//! Running it against real ELFs built from that commit walked the refusal
//! through three walls in one afternoon, and each one is worth having named:
//!
//! 1. `BuilderError::Projection("borrowed-range-resolve")` -- GONE. This was
//!    the artifact contradiction and it was the only one of the three that was
//!    program code.
//! 2. The operator and the bundle builder disagreed in exactly ONE byte of a
//!    256-byte instruction: envelope offset 127, the eighth bump hint, the
//!    Custody transfer authority. Both envelopes are VALID -- an absent hint
//!    means the route searches rather than refuses -- so no program would ever
//!    have reported it, and only the fixture's exact cross-check could. The
//!    cause was that this fixture handed the operator a ZERO-LENGTH activation
//!    cache at Hot coordinate 22 while the bank held the real one:
//!    `activated_custody_program_v1` read nothing out of it and the operator
//!    honestly mined an absent hint. Repaired here by giving the operator the
//!    account the bank actually holds (`Releases::activation_data`).
//! 3. Where it stops today: `runtime=39` against `geometry.physical=44`, the
//!    conjunct `support/series_premarket_expiry_v1.rs::validate_physical_bindings`
//!    measured on 2026-09-01 and names in full. The five missing coordinates
//!    are `72 template_staging`, `73 occurrence_raw`, `74 occurrence_staging`,
//!    `75 ticket_raw`, `76 ticket_staging` -- the finalized Series record
//!    raw/staging accounts Core needs to rebuild the Expire request. This file
//!    contains no reference to any of the five, so they are never constructed,
//!    installed, or packed. That is fixture work, and it is the next unit.
//!
//! # WHAT THE ARTIFACT REPAIR ACTUALLY WAS, kept because it is not obvious
//!
//! The Series kernel had already decided it. `series_proof_count_v3` (formerly
//! the private `proof_height`) is compared by EQUALITY in
//! `admit_occurrence_bytes`, not as a floor, and it is a function of immutable
//! Template config alone. So `128 + 32 * count` is a per-Template CONSTANT
//! knowable before any request exists, and the artifacts had been written as
//! if the proof width were a runtime variable. It never was.
//!
//! Both spellings of "a borrowed thing is here" are canonically nonempty --
//! `BorrowedRangeV4::resolve` refuses a zero length and
//! `BorrowedWitnessPolicyV3::validate` refuses a zero minimum -- so a Template
//! whose canonical proof is empty declares NO range rather than one that
//! resolves to zero. Coverage still closes on its own:
//! `validate_request_coverage` starts its cursor at the 128-byte semantic
//! prefix and requires it to reach the request's exact end.
//!
//! The repair had four authors and this file was none of them: the artifact,
//! `hot_v3.rs`'s replay-overlap conjunct (which required `ranges.count() == 1`
//! and would have gone silent), `effect_v4.rs`'s per-route `borrowed_range_count()`
//! pin, and the shadow generator's source manifest. `consume_artifacts_v4` was
//! HALF in the same position: its Effect shared the defect, but its
//! RequestProfile did not -- `authenticate_series_consume_artifacts_v4` splits
//! the proof off itself and REQUIRES a 128-byte profile, where Expire is
//! authenticated by the generic Hot path against the complete request.
